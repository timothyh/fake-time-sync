fake-time-sync

(Yet another) Trivial shell script to do a clock sync for systems with
no hardware real-time clock, such as Rasberry Pi's. It is intended to
run as early as possible in boot sequence, typically right after local
filesystems are mounted.

Directories vwith high volatility are searched for most recent
modification time, which is then used as system time. Under normal
conditions this will get the system clock close to the actual time.

This script expects to be installed in /opt/fake-time-sync.

The install.sh script sets up a systemd service to run this script
right after local file systems are mounted.

For troubleshooting, examine /tmp/fake-time-sync.log as the clock set
seems to mess with system journals/logging.

Tested on Fedora but should work on other systemd based systems.
